    <p> </p><b> Notes from Stage 0</b> </p>

<P> <b> HTML </b>
<div> HTML is hyper text markup language, and is the basic language of documents on the web.
  
  It is made up of text content (what is actually displayed), markup (the formatting), references to other documents (images, videos etc), and (hyper)links to other pages on the internet.

<p> <b> Tags </b></p>
<p> There are a number of different tags, that perform different functions on the HTML. <br>
  For instance, the b tag makes text bold, the em tag makes it italic.<br>
  Tags can also be used to add images or links, and can be seen in the video below: <br>

<p> <b> Inline vs Block </b></p>

<p> Tags, and elements more generally (the complete unit made up of two tags and their contents), can either be inline or block. The distinction is relatively simple, with inline elements such as b, img etc. taking their place "in the line" of the text, whereas block elements take the place of a separate block on the page.
  
  <a href="https://youtu.be/bOh9WjucNsA" > This video </a> does a good job of explaining the distinction.
